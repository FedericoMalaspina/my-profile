	<p>
		Born and raised in London by a quadria-lingual family, I currently study business management at ESSEC business school with the goal of entering the business and finance industry once over. 
	</p>
	<p>
		My interests lie with applied mathematics, marketing and finance as well as the current geopolitical plane. I am an avid Judoka since the age of four, I learn different cuisines as a hobby and have the ABRSM grade 5 in trumpet.

	<h1>Interests</h1>

	<img class="avatar" src="images/judo.jpg">
	<p>My academic interests lie with economics, mathematics, finance and marketing. These are derived from my independent interests in mathematics and psychology, both of which I believe to be key to understand the former. I equally enjoy software manipulation such as Excel modelling, web development and learning python.</p>
	<p>
		Since the age of four, Judo has been one of the great pillars of my life, acting as the root of many of my beliefs, values and principles to this day. My other sporting interests include swimming, weight lifting and basket ball.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my free time I enjoy cooking, playing the trumpet (ABRSM Grade 5), reading psychology or economics articles and chatting to my friends when I can't see them in person.
